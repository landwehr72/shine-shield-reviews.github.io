  <p>Honest detailing product reviews from Florida's coast</p>
</div>

<div class="about-content">
  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>Salt Life Detail was born from a passion for keeping boats and cars looking their best in Florida's challenging coastal environment. Between the salt air, intense UV rays, and year-round outdoor lifestyle, we needed products that actually work – not just marketing hype.</p>
  
  <h2>Our Promise</h2>
  <p>Every product we review has been personally purchased and tested. No sponsored content, no affiliate bias – just honest reviews from someone who actually uses this stuff on boats and cars.</p>
  
  <h2>Our Testing Process</h2>
  <ul class="testing-list">
    <li><strong>Real-world conditions:</strong> We test in actual saltwater and freshwater environments</li>
    <li><strong>Long-term testing:</strong> Products are evaluated over months, not days</li>
    <li><strong>Multiple vehicles:</strong> Testing on different paint types and surfaces</li>
    <li><strong>Honest documentation:</strong> Photos and detailed notes throughout the process</li>
  </ul>
